## **Level 4 - Full Stack Developer Course**
My exciting journey with Mission Ready began in October,&nbsp;2023,&nbsp;where I undertook the Level 4 Full-Stack Developer course.&nbsp;
I was supported by many exceptional trainers&nbsp;-&nbsp;Phoebe,&nbsp;Bonnie,&nbsp;Joseph,&nbsp;Heni and Jordan. They provided an incredibly supportive
and enriching learning environment. 
<br>
<br>
This course really helped me understand the fundamentals of both frontend and backend development. I gained proficiency in React and Node.js,&nbsp;enabling&nbsp;
me to build robust webpages with these newfound skills. I particularly enjoyed the final mission as it was very collaborative, and allowed me to work&nbsp;
effectively in a team.
<br>
<br>
Overall,&nbsp;Level 4 was a very positive experience and laid a strong foundation for my journey in software development.

## **Level 5 - DevOps (Cloud and AI) Course**
I moved onto the Level 5 DevOps AI&nbsp;&&nbsp;Cloud course in February 2025,&nbsp; where I learnt more broader software topics such as&nbsp;
AI,&nbsp;Cloud computing,&nbsp;CI/CD,&nbsp;deployment and more. This course helped me become more independent and gave me a deeper understanding of the
wider aspects of software development.
<br>
<br>
One of the highlights of this course was collaborating with the UX designer students, particualrly on the final mission, where we redesigned the Trade Me website. I found
it enjoyable replicating their designs and honing my frontend skills, making the experience both challenging and fun.

It was amazing having the opportunity to work on real projects in a professional environment. Foodstuffs was a great place to work at,&nbsp;there&nbsp;
were a lot of supportive people,&nbsp;great benefits and a flexible workstyle. I heavily enjoyed working with the two UX designers from Mission Ready&nbsp;-&nbsp;
Ryan and Mikie.

Our main project involved redesigning an existing Pak'n'Save basket report into SAP Analytics Cloud. I learned how to use the SAC story creation tool to build the reporting
dashboard from scratch,&nbsp;with JavaScript. I was also heavily involved in the UX design process,&nbsp;conducting interviews and&nbsp;performing user testing. This was a
very challenging but rewarding experience that helped me gain essential skills such as working in an agile environment,&nbsp;focusing on user-centric solutions,&nbsp;and also honing my presentation skills.

It was a pleasure working at Foodstuffs,&nbsp;and I look forward to any future opportunities with them!
<br>
<br>
